# Image Processing and Geospatial Data Mapping Web Application

This project is a web-based application built with Flask that uses machine learning for image processing and prediction.
Additionally, it provides a feature to visualize geospatial data on a map. T
he application allows users to upload images and geospatial data files, processes them, and displays the results using various Python libraries, including TensorFlow and GeoPandas.

## Features

- **Image Upload and Prediction**: Users can upload images via the web interface. The application processes the images and generates predictions using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- **Geospatial Data Visualization**: Users can upload geospatial data files (e.g., shapefiles), and the application will render maps using GeoPandas and Matplotlib.
- **Visualization Tools**: Visualize results using Matplotlib for image data and GeoPandas for geospatial data.
